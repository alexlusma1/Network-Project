Project Title: Simple Network Monitoring Tool

Project Description:
Create a simple network monitoring tool that allows users to monitor the status of devices on their local network. 
This tool will provide basic information about devices such as their IP address, MAC address, and current status (online/offline).

Features:

Device Discovery: Implement a feature to scan the local network and discover active devices. You can use libraries like scapy or nmap to accomplish this.
Device Information: Retrieve and display basic information about each discovered device, including its IP address, MAC address, and hostname.
Ping Status: Implement a ping functionality to check the online status of each discovered device. Display whether each device is currently online or offline.
Graphical User Interface (Optional): Create a simple GUI to present the network information in a user-friendly manner. You can use libraries like Tkinter for Python or Electron for JavaScript to build the GUI.
Logging: Implement logging functionality to record network scan results and device status changes over time. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and historical analysis.
Technologies:

Python (for backend functionality)
Scapy or Nmap (for network scanning)
Tkinter (for GUI, if applicable)
Logging library (e.g., Python's logging module)
Potential Extensions:

Email Alerts: Add functionality to send email alerts when certain devices go offline or when the network scan encounters errors.
Device Details: Enhance the tool to retrieve additional information about devices, such as open ports or services running on them.
Remote Monitoring: Extend the tool to support monitoring of devices on remote networks, possibly using SSH or other remote access protocols.

This project will provide you with a practical understanding of network scanning, device discovery, and basic GUI development. 
Additionally, it will serve as a valuable tool for monitoring and managing devices on your local network.
